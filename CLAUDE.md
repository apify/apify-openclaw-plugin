# Apify OpenClaw Integration — Repository Guidelines

## Overview

This is a standalone OpenClaw plugin (`@apify/apify-openclaw-plugin`) that provides web scraping and data extraction via Apify's API. It registers **1 agent tool** (`apify`) — a universal scraper with 3 actions: `discover`, `start`, and `collect`.

## The `apify` Tool

Single tool with 3 actions:

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `discover` + `query` | Search Apify Store for actors by keyword |
| `discover` + `actorId` | Fetch actor's input schema + README |
| `start` + `actorId` + `input` | Fire an actor run, returns runId/datasetId |
| `collect` + `runs` | Poll status, return results for completed runs |

### Tool Description Guidance

The tool description includes instructions for the agent:
- **Sub-agent delegation:** Tool should be used by a sub-agent that returns only relevant extracted data, not raw dumps.
- **Batching:** Batch multiple URLs into a single run (e.g. `startUrls: [{url: "..."}, ...]`).
- **Known actors:** Compact comma-separated list of 20k+ actors across Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Google Maps, and more.
- **Support:** Directs users to integrations@apify.com for issues.

## Key Architecture Decisions

- **Single tool, multiple actions:** All scraping goes through `apify` with `discover`/`start`/`collect` actions.
- **Async two-phase pattern:** `start` returns immediately with run references. `collect` polls and fetches results. The agent does other work between calls.
- **`apify-client` SDK:** Uses the official `apify-client` npm package (not raw HTTP). Client created via `createApifyClient(apiKey, baseUrl)`.
- **Inlined utilities (`util.ts`):** `ToolInputError`, `normalizeSecretInput`, and `wrapExternalContent` are NOT exported from `openclaw/plugin-sdk`. We carry local copies.
- **No build step:** OpenClaw loads plugins via `jiti` (TypeScript JIT). We ship `.ts` source directly.
- **No skills:** Skills were removed — the tool description and `discover` action provide all needed guidance.

## Apify Actor IDs

**Format: `username~actor-name`** (tilde separator, not slash).

The `~` format avoids URL path ambiguity. The `discover` action builds slugs as `${username}~${name}`.

## Plugin ID — single source of truth (+ the ClawHub id split)

There are **two** ids in play and it matters which is which:

- **Canonical id = `apify-openclaw-plugin`.** This is what ships to npm and what the OpenClaw installer keys on. It lives as a literal in **exactly one place**: `openclaw.plugin.json` `"id"`.
- **ClawHub id = `apify`.** ClawHub has this plugin registered under the shorter id `apify` (that's what existing ClawHub users installed). We publish to ClawHub under `apify` **only**.

### Everything derives from the manifest — do NOT hardcode the id

`openclaw.plugin.json` is the sole literal. The OpenClaw loader reads the id from that JSON *before any plugin code runs* (`node_modules/openclaw/dist/loader-*.js`), so it must be a literal there. Everything else derives from it:

| Consumer | How it gets the id |
|----------|--------------------|
| `src/index.ts` default export | **omits `id`** — the loader only checks the export id *if present* (and fails on mismatch), so we leave it out. |
| `src/cli.ts` (config entry key, `plugins.allow`, manual-config printout) | uses **`api.id`** at runtime (OpenClawPluginApi exposes `api.id`). `printManualConfig(pluginId, …)` takes it as a param. |
| `package.json` `openclaw.id` | **removed** — not read by the runtime loader, was redundant. |
| `scripts/bump-openclaw.mjs` | reads `openclaw.plugin.json` `id` at runtime. |
| `.github/workflows/openclaw_version_tests.yml` | `PLUGIN_ID=$(jq -r .id openclaw.plugin.json)`. |

So to change the canonical id you edit **one** literal (the manifest). To change the ClawHub id you edit **one** constant (`CLAWHUB_ID` in `scripts/publish-clawhub.mjs`).

### Publishing to ClawHub — `scripts/publish-clawhub.mjs`

The reusable `openclaw/clawhub` publish workflow packs the repo verbatim with **no id/name override**, so it cannot publish a different id than the manifest carries. Instead we run the ClawHub CLI ourselves:

```
npm run publish:clawhub            # = npm run build && node scripts/publish-clawhub.mjs
npm run publish:clawhub -- --dry-run
```

The script: (1) rewrites the manifest `id` → `apify`, (2) runs `clawhub package publish . --family code-plugin --owner apify`, (3) **always restores** the original `apify-openclaw-plugin` manifest (even on failure/signal), so the working tree is never left mutated. `dist` is id-agnostic (code uses `api.id`), so no id-specific rebuild is needed — but the npm script rebuilds anyway to keep the packed `dist` fresh. Auth: the ClawHub CLI does **not** consume `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` directly — it reads credentials from its own config. CI therefore runs `clawhub login --token "$CLAWHUB_TOKEN"` first (or sets `CLAWHUB_CONFIG_PATH` to a pre-seeded config file); locally it relies on an existing interactive `clawhub login`. Setting `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` alone does not authenticate the CLI and would 401.

## Setup Wizard — Direct Config Write

`openclaw apify setup` (in `src/cli.ts`) writes config directly to the OpenClaw config file.

It uses:
- `api.runtime.config.loadConfig()` → returns current `OpenClawConfig`
- `api.runtime.config.writeConfigFile(cfg)` → writes it back to disk

The wizard merges safely: preserves existing config, adds to `tools.alsoAllow` without duplicates, uses `group:plugins` when all tools are selected.

## Build, Test, and Development

- **Runtime:** Node 24.16+ (the pinned openclaw devDependency requires it; 2026.9.3+ dropped Node 22).
- **Install:** `npm install`
- **Type-check:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Test:** `npx vitest run`
- **Pack (dry run):** `npm pack --dry-run`
- **Bump OpenClaw to latest:** `npm run bump:openclaw` *(install-tests against the latest openclaw release, then updates `devDependencies.openclaw` + the `build`/`compat` version fields if it passes; user reviews and commits)*
- **Current state:** 1 test file, 10 tests passing.

## Updating the OpenClaw Version

The publish workflow blocks any GitHub release whose pinned openclaw version lags behind the latest release on npm (OpenClaw ships ~daily, so this check is **not** enforced on every PR/commit — it would just be busy-work — only at release time). To keep up:

1. Run `npm run bump:openclaw`. The script packs the plugin, installs it against the latest openclaw release in a temp directory, runs `plugins list` + `plugins inspect` (same smoke as CI), then runs local `typecheck` + `vitest`. If any step fails, no files are touched.
2. On success, `package.json` (`devDependencies.openclaw`, `openclaw.build.openclawVersion`, `openclaw.compat.builtWithOpenClawVersion`, `openclaw.compat.pluginSdkVersion`) and `package-lock.json` are updated. Review `git diff`, then commit as `chore: bump openclaw to <version>`.
3. `peerDependencies.openclaw` uses `">="` and is intentionally not touched.

Claude should default to this script when asked to bump OpenClaw or when the publish-time version gate fails — do not run the underlying `npm install --save-dev openclaw@X` + `npm pkg set ...` commands manually.

### `scripts/openclaw-version.mjs` — the single source of truth

All three consumers (the bump script, the publish gate, the version-test matrix) resolve "latest openclaw" through this one module. Keep it that way — when they disagreed, releases deadlocked.

**The `X.Y.Z-N` trap.** OpenClaw respins a patch as `2026.7.1-1`, `2026.7.1-2`, … and moves the `latest` dist-tag onto it. Strict semver reads that suffix as a *pre-release* (lower than `2026.7.1`), so:
- A `select(test("-") | not)` filter hides the version most users actually install.
- The old gate used `npm view openclaw version` (dist-tag → `2026.7.1-2`) while the bump script filtered dashes out (→ `2026.7.1`). `npm run bump:openclaw` could therefore never satisfy the gate — an unfixable release failure.

The module's rule: a **release** matches `/^\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-\d+)?$/`, and `compareVersions` sorts `X.Y.Z-N` **above** `X.Y.Z` (deliberately inverting semver). Genuine pre-releases (`-alpha.1`, `-beta.7`) are still excluded.

- `latest` — the `latest` dist-tag when it's a release version, else the highest published release.
- `matrix [n]` — JSON array of the newest n *patch lines*, collapsed to the newest respin of each (so the matrix doesn't burn three legs on `2026.7.1`, `-1`, `-2`).
- `check` — the publish gate. Fails only when a `package.json` field is **behind** latest; being ahead is fine, so an openclaw release landing mid-publish can't break a release.

## CI Workflows

### `ci.yml` — fast PR gate
- Pins npm to the release major, then runs `npm ci` + `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run` + `npm run build` on Node 24.
- Triggers on push/PR to `main`.
- Uses `npm ci`, **not** `npm install` — install must fail on a stale/incomplete lockfile instead of silently rewriting it. With `npm install` here, CI stayed green while the release job died on the same commit.

### `publish.yml` — release to npm + ClawHub
Triggered by a published GitHub Release. Two jobs:

- **`release`** — the npm publish path, id stays canonical (`apify-openclaw-plugin`). Upgrades npm to the pinned major, `npm ci`, runs the openclaw-version gate (`node scripts/openclaw-version.mjs check`), bumps `package.json` to the release tag (idempotent — skipped if already at that version), type-checks, tests, builds, commits the version bump back to the release branch, then `npm publish --provenance --access public` (skipped if that version is already on npm).
- **`publish-clawhub`** (`needs: release`) — the ClawHub publish path, id flipped to `apify`. Checks out `target_commitish` (main, *after* the version-bump commit), `npm ci`, installs the `clawhub` CLI, then runs `npm run publish:clawhub` which invokes `scripts/publish-clawhub.mjs`. That script renames the manifest id → `apify`, publishes, and restores the canonical id. This is done **in-house rather than via the reusable `openclaw/clawhub` package-publish workflow** because that workflow packs the repo verbatim with no id override — see the "Publishing to ClawHub" section.
  - Auth: the ClawHub CLI does **not** read `CLAWHUB_TOKEN` directly, so a dedicated **`Authenticate ClawHub CLI`** step runs `clawhub login --token "$CLAWHUB_TOKEN"` (`secrets.APIFY_CLAWHUB_TOKEN`) **before** the publish step; the login persists on the runner so the publish step is authenticated (alternatively `CLAWHUB_CONFIG_PATH` can point at a pre-seeded config file, as the reusable workflow does). Publishing uses `--manual-override-reason` to record the id rename.

### The npm major / lockfile trap

**Every place that installs or writes `package-lock.json` must use the same npm major.** It is pinned to `12` in three spots — `NPM_VERSION` in `ci.yml` and `publish.yml`, and `RELEASE_NPM` in `scripts/bump-openclaw.mjs`. Keep them in sync.

Why: npm majors generate materially different lock trees, and `npm ci` hard-fails on a lock written by a different major. Concretely, npm 11 hoisted `@types/retry@0.12.5` into `openclaw/node_modules/` and **omitted** the `@types/retry@0.12.0` that `p-retry` pins exactly. npm 11 accepted its own lock; npm 12 correctly rejected it with `Missing: @types/retry@0.12.0 from lock file`. Because `publish.yml` upgraded to a floating `npm@latest`, releases started failing the day npm 12 shipped — with **no repo change at all**, and nothing reproducible locally on npm 11.

To move majors: bump `NPM_VERSION` in both workflows and `RELEASE_NPM` in the bump script, regenerate the lock with that npm (`npx -y npm@<major> install`), and commit all of it together.

### `openclaw_version_tests.yml` — OpenClaw runtime compatibility matrix
Validates the plugin actually installs and loads inside a real OpenClaw runtime.

- **Triggers:**
  - `pull_request` to `main` — packs the PR branch (`npm install && npm pack`) and installs that tarball, so each PR is validated against its own diff.
  - `schedule` — Mondays at `07:00` UTC (`0 7 * * 1`), which is 8am Prague (CET) in winter / 9am Prague (CEST) in summer.
  - `workflow_dispatch` — manual re-run.
- **Schedule / dispatch mode:** installs `@apify/apify-openclaw-plugin@latest` from npm (validates the currently-shipping release).
- **Versions tested:** the `discover` job calls `npm view openclaw versions --json`, drops pre-releases (anything containing `-`), `sort -V | tail -n 3` to pick the latest 3 stable versions. Auto-updates — no manual list maintenance.
- **Smoke test per version:** all four phases run in **one consolidated bash step** that `cd`s to `$RUNNER_TEMP/openclaw-test` (splitting across steps with `working-directory:` caused a path mismatch — don't do that):
  1. `npm install openclaw@<matrix-version>` in a fresh `$RUNNER_TEMP/openclaw-test` dir.
  2. `npx openclaw plugins install <spec>` (tarball path on PR; `@latest` on schedule).
  3. `npx openclaw plugins list` — echoed for diagnostics only. **Do NOT grep this output:** the rendered table word-wraps long ids/paths across cells, so `apify-openclaw-plugin` rarely appears as a contiguous substring. A prior grep gate here broke against 2026.5.26 / 2026.5.27 when the npm install layout changed.
  4. `npx openclaw plugins inspect apify-openclaw-plugin --runtime --json` — this is the real load assertion. `inspect` exits non-zero if the plugin id isn't registered, and the JSON is checked with `jq '.. | strings | select(. == "apify")'` to confirm the `apify` tool surfaces (matched loosely since the JSON shape may evolve across OpenClaw versions).
- **Aggregator job (`required`)** — runs after the matrix with `if: always()`, fails if `discover` or `test` didn't succeed. This is the **stable required status check** in branch protection — the per-version matrix legs (`OpenClaw 2026.x.y`) rotate as discovery picks up new releases, so don't pin those.
- **Slack notification** — a `notify` job is scaffolded but commented out. To re-enable, uncomment it and add a `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` repo secret; it only fires on `schedule` failures.

### Branch protection on `main`
- `required` (the aggregator job above) is enforced as a required status check via the GitHub branch protection API.
- Set up via `gh api -X PUT repos/apify/apify-openclaw-plugin/branches/main/protection --input -` with a JSON body — the flag-form `-F nested.key=value` doesn't work for the nested object schema.

## Coding Style

- TypeScript (ESM). Prefer strict typing; avoid `any`.
- Tool names: `snake_case` (e.g., `apify`).
- Plugin id / config keys: `kebab-case` (e.g., `apify`).
- Keep files concise. Add comments for non-obvious logic.
- Tool schema guardrails: avoid `Type.Union`. Use `stringEnum` for string enums, `Type.Optional(...)` instead of nullable types.

## How the OpenClaw Plugin System Works

This section documents how OpenClaw discovers, loads, and runs plugins. Reference this when modifying the plugin or debugging integration issues.

### Plugin Lifecycle

```
Discovery → Manifest Loading → Config Validation → Module Loading → Registration → Tool Resolution
```

#### 1. Discovery

OpenClaw scans for plugins in strict precedence order:

1. **Config paths** (`plugins.load.paths`) — highest priority
2. **Workspace extensions** (`<workspace>/.openclaw/extensions/`)
3. **Global extensions** (`~/.config/openclaw/extensions/` or `~/.openclaw/extensions/`)
4. **Bundled extensions** (shipped with OpenClaw) — lowest priority

For npm-installed plugins: `openclaw plugins install <npm-spec>` runs `npm pack`, extracts the tarball into `~/.openclaw/extensions/<id>/`, and runs `npm install --ignore-scripts` for dependencies.

The plugin id is derived from the **unscoped** npm package name. For `@apify/apify-openclaw-plugin`, the id = `apify-openclaw-plugin`. The manifest, default export, and `plugins.entries` config key all use this id.

#### 2. Manifest Loading

Every plugin **must** ship `openclaw.plugin.json` in its root. This file is loaded **without executing plugin code** and provides:

- `id` (string, required) — canonical plugin identifier
- `configSchema` (JSON Schema, required) — validated before code runs
- `uiHints` (optional) — field labels, placeholders, sensitive flags for the Control UI

#### 3. Config Validation

Plugin config from `plugins.entries.<id>.config` is validated against the manifest's `configSchema` using JSON Schema. Invalid config blocks the plugin from loading entirely.

#### 4. Module Loading via Jiti

OpenClaw uses [Jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti) to import the plugin entry file with an alias from `"openclaw/plugin-sdk"` → the local OpenClaw SDK.

**Critical gotcha:** If `register()` returns a Promise, the async work is **silently ignored**. All registration must be synchronous.

#### 5. Registration

Our plugin calls `api.registerTool(tool)` for `apify` and `api.registerCli(...)` for the `apify` CLI subcommand.

#### 6. Tool Resolution at Runtime

Tool names that collide with core tool names are silently dropped. Plugin tools are gated by allowlists (`tools.alsoAllow`).

### Gateway Config Structure

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    enabled: true,
    entries: {
      "apify-openclaw-plugin": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {
          apiKey: "apify_api_...",     // or use APIFY_API_KEY env var
          baseUrl: "https://api.apify.com",
          maxResults: 20,
          enabledTools: [],           // empty = all tools enabled
        },
      },
    },
  },
  tools: {
    alsoAllow: ["group:plugins"],   // or the "apify" tool name
  },
}
```

Config changes require a gateway restart (`openclaw gateway restart`).

---

## External Content Security Model

All scraped data is **untrusted external content**. The `wrapExternalContent(content, options)` function (in `util.ts`) sanitizes marker strings and wraps content between boundary markers with source metadata.

---

## Security

- **API keys:** Resolved from plugin config `apiKey` or `APIFY_API_KEY` env var. Never logged or included in tool output.
- **Base URL validation:** Only `https://api.apify.com` prefix allowed. Rejects other URLs to prevent SSRF.
- **External content wrapping:** All scraped results wrapped with untrusted content markers.

---

## Important Gotchas

1. **Async `register()` is ignored.** Must be synchronous. Our `register()` is sync.
2. **`openclaw.plugin.json` is mandatory.** Without it, the plugin never loads.
3. **Tool name collisions are silent drops.** If a tool name collides with a core tool, it gets skipped.
4. **Config validation happens before code.** Invalid config = plugin won't load.
5. **`workspace:*` deps break outside the monorepo.** We use `"openclaw": "^2026.2.18"` in devDependencies.
6. **Plugin tools are gated by allowlists.** Users must add tool names or `group:plugins` to `tools.alsoAllow`.
7. **No `Type.Union` in schemas.** OpenClaw rejects `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`. Use `stringEnum()` and `Type.Optional()`.
8. **Don't rename the canonical plugin id.** It was renamed `apify` → `apify-openclaw-plugin` between v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 and broke every existing user's update flow (OpenClaw's installer rejects id mismatches before any migration logic runs). `scripts/migrate-id.mjs` exists as the user-facing workaround. If a future rename is unavoidable, ship another migration script and document it in the README. **Note the deliberate exception:** ClawHub knows this plugin by the shorter id `apify`, so the release pipeline flips the manifest id to `apify` *only* for the ClawHub upload via `scripts/publish-clawhub.mjs` (npm still gets the canonical `apify-openclaw-plugin`). See the "Plugin ID — single source of truth" section — that is intentional and must not be "fixed" by aligning the two.
